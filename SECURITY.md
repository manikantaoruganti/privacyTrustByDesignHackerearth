# Security Policy

## Privacy by Design

DocuShield AI is built with privacy as the foundational principle. This document outlines our security practices and privacy guarantees.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Guarantees

### Local Processing Only
- **No External Calls**: All document processing happens locally on your device
- **No Data Transmission**: No document content is ever sent to external servers
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: All ML models are bundled locally
- **Offline Operation**: Works without internet connection after installation

### Data Handling
- **In-Memory Processing**: Documents processed in memory by default
- **Temporary Storage**: Optional temporary disk storage (configurable)
- **Secure Deletion**: Memory buffers overwritten before deallocation
- **No Persistent Storage**: Original files not stored after processing

### Audit Logging
- **Metadata Only**: Audit logs contain only bounding boxes, PII types, and timestamps
- **No Content Logging**: Raw text or images are never logged
- **Configurable**: Audit logging can be disabled entirely
- **Local Storage**: Audit files remain on your local system

## üîí Security Features

### Input Validation
- **File Type Restrictions**: Only supported formats accepted (PDF, JPG, PNG, TIFF)
- **Size Limits**: Configurable maximum file size (default: 200MB)
- **Content Validation**: Files scanned for malicious content
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Upload paths sanitized

### Memory Safety
- **Buffer Management**: Secure allocation and deallocation of memory
- **Overflow Protection**: Bounds checking on all data operations  
- **Stack Protection**: Memory corruption safeguards
- **Secure Cleanup**: Explicit zeroing of sensitive data

### Access Control
- **Local Access Only**: Web interface binds to localhost by default
- **No Authentication Required**: Since processing is local-only
- **Process Isolation**: Docker containerization available
- **Privilege Separation**: Runs with minimal required permissions

### Error Handling
- **No Information Leakage**: Error messages don't expose sensitive data
- **Graceful Failures**: Secure failure modes that protect data
- **Exception Safety**: Memory cleanup on error conditions
- **Logging Safety**: Error logs exclude sensitive content

## üîç Vulnerability Handling

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@docushield.ai]
3. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
4. Allow 48 hours for initial response

### Supported Versions
| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No     |

### Security Updates
- Critical security fixes released immediately
- Security advisories published for all severity levels
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security audits of codebase

## üõ†Ô∏è Secure Configuration

### Recommended Settings
```yaml
# configs/default.yaml
security:
  max_file_size_mb: 200
  allowed_origins: ["http://localhost:8080"]
  enable_cors: false
  log_level: "INFO"  # Avoid DEBUG in production
  
io:
  use_ramdisk: true  # Keep processing in memory
  temp_storage: false  # Disable temporary files
  
logs:
  audit_enabled: true
  include_content: false  # Never log actual content
```

### Deployment Security
```bash
# Run with restricted permissions
docker run --read-only --tmpfs /app/temp docushield-ai

# Network isolation  
docker run --network none docushield-ai

# Resource limits
docker run --memory=2g --cpus=2 docushield-ai
```

### Environment Hardening
- Run in read-only containers when possible
- Use temporary filesystems for processing
- Limit memory and CPU resources
- Disable unnecessary network access

## üìã Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Run security vulnerability scans
- [ ] Verify model file checksums
- [ ] Test with sample malicious files
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Confirm no debug logging in production

### Runtime Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor memory usage patterns
- [ ] Watch for unusual CPU spikes
- [ ] Track failed processing attempts  
- [ ] Monitor disk space usage
- [ ] Verify no network connections established

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Rotate any API keys (if used)
- [ ] Review audit logs for anomalies
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Validate backup integrity

## üîê Cryptographic Standards

### Hash Functions
- **SHA-256**: Used for model file verification
- **BLAKE2**: Alternative hash for performance-critical operations
- **No MD5/SHA1**: Legacy hash functions avoided

### Secure Random Generation
- **OS Entropy**: Uses operating system random number generator
- **Job IDs**: Cryptographically secure UUID generation
- **No Predictable Values**: All random values use secure sources

## üè¢ Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection Regulations
- **GDPR Compliant**: No personal data processed externally
- **HIPAA Friendly**: Suitable for healthcare document processing
- **SOC 2**: Supports security and availability requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Aligns with information security standards

### Audit Trail
- **Immutable Logs**: Audit entries cannot be modified after creation
- **Timestamp Integrity**: All events timestamped with UTC
- **Chain of Custody**: Complete processing history maintained
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable log retention periods
